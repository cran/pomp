\title{The measurement-model simulator}
\description{
Specification of rmeasure
}
\details{
The measurement model is the link between the data and the unobserved state process.
It can be specified either by using one or both of the \code{rmeasure} and \code{dmeasure} arguments.

Suppose you have a procedure to simulate observations given the value of the latent state variables.
Then you can furnish \preformatted{
  rmeasure = f}
to \pkg{pomp} algorithms,
where \code{f} is a C snippet or \R function that implements your procedure.

Using a C snippet is much preferred, due to its much greater computational efficiency.
See \code{\link{Csnippet}} for general rules on writing C snippets.

In writing an \code{rmeasure} C snippet, bear in mind that:
  \enumerate{
    \item The goal of such a snippet is to fill the observables with random values drawn from the measurement model distribution.
    Accordingly, each observable should be assigned a new value.
    \item In addition to the states, parameters, covariates (if any), and observables, the variable \code{t}, containing the time of the observation, will be defined in the context in which the snippet is executed.
  }

The demos and the tutorials on the \href{https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/}{package website} give examples as well.

It is also possible, though far less efficient, to specify \code{rmeasure} using an \R function.
In this case, specify the measurement model simulator by furnishing \preformatted{
  rmeasure = f}
to \code{pomp}, where \code{f} is an \R function.
The arguments of \code{f} should be chosen from among the state variables, parameters, covariates, and time.
It must also have the argument \code{...}.
\code{f} must return a named numeric vector of length equal to the number of observable variables.
}
\section{Default behavior}{

The default \code{rmeasure} is undefined.
It will yield missing values (\code{NA}).
