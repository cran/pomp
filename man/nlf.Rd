\title{Fit Model to Data Using Nonlinear Forecasting (NLF)}
\description{
  Calls an optimizer to maximize the nonlinear forecasting (NLF) goodness of fit, by simulating data from a model, fitting a nonlinear autoregressive model to the simulated time series (which may be multivariate) and using the fitted model to predict some or all variables in the data time series.
  NLF is an 'indirect inference' method using a quasi-likelihood as the objective function.
}
\usage{
 nlf(object, start, est, lags, period = NA, tensor = FALSE,
     nconverge=1000, nasymp=1000, seed = 1066, nrbf = 4,
     method = 'subplex', skip.se = FALSE, verbose = FALSE, gr = NULL,
     bootstrap=FALSE, bootsamp = NULL,
     lql.frac = 0.1, se.par.frac = 0.1, eval.only = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{
    A \code{pomp} object, with the data and model to fit to it.
  }
  \item{start}{
    Named numeric vector with guessed parameters.
  }
  \item{est}{
    Vector containing the names or indices of parameters to be estimated.
  }
  \item{lags}{
    A vector specifying the lags to use when constructing the nonlinear autoregressive prediction model.
    The first lag is the prediction interval.
  }
 \item{period}{
   numeric; \code{period=NA} means the model is nonseasonal.
   period>0 is the period of seasonal forcing in 'real time'.
 }
 \item{tensor}{
   logical;
   if FALSE, the fitted model is a generalized additive model with time mod period as one of the predictors, i.e., a gam with time-varying intercept. 
   If TRUE, the fitted model is a gam with lagged state variables as predictors and time-periodic coefficients, constructed using tensor products of basis functions of state variables with basis functions of time.
   }
   \item{nconverge}{
     Number of convergence timesteps to be discarded from the model simulation.
   }
  \item{nasymp}{
    Number of asymptotic timesteps to be recorded from the model simulation.
  }
  \item{seed}{
    Integer specifying the random number seed to use.
    When fitting, it is usually best to always run the simulations with the same sequence of random numbers, which is accomplished by setting \code{seed} to an integer.
    If you want a truly random simulation, set \code{seed=NULL}.
  }
  \item{nrbf}{A scalar specifying the number of radial basis functions to be used at each lag.}
  \item{method}{
    Optimization method.
    Choices are \code{\link[subplex]{subplex}} and any of the methods used by \code{\link{optim}}.
  }
  \item{skip.se}{
    Logical; if \code{TRUE}, skip the computation of standard errors.
  }
  \item{verbose}{
    Logical; if \code{TRUE}, the negative log quasilikelihood and parameter values are printed at each iteration of the optimizer.
  }
  \item{gr}{optional; passed to \code{optim} if \code{optim} is used.}
  \item{bootstrap}{
    Logical;
    if \code{TRUE} the indices in \code{bootsamp} will determine which of the conditional likelihood values be used in computing the quasi-loglikelihood.
  }
  \item{bootsamp}{
    Vector of integers;
    used to have the quasi-loglikelihood evaluated using a bootstrap re-sampling of the data set.
  } 
  \item{lql.frac}{
    target fractional change in log quasi-likelihood for quadratic standard error estimate
  } 
  \item{se.par.frac}{
    initial parameter-change fraction for quadratic standard error estimate
  } 
  \item{eval.only}{
    logical; if \code{TRUE}, no optimization is attempted and the quasi-loglikelihood value is evaluated at the \code{start} parameters.
  } 
  \item{\dots}{
    Arguments that will be passed to \code{optim} in the \code{control} list.
  }
}
\details{
  This is functionally a wrapper for \code{nlf.objfun}, which does the statistical heavy lifting and should be consulted for details.
}
\value{
  A list corresponding to the output from the optimizer, except that the full parameter vector is returned (not just the ones fitted), the LQL (and not -LQL) is reported, xstart is included, and asymptotic Wald standard errors based on M-estimator theory are returned for each fitted parameter.
