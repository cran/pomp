  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo methods have emerged
	as the two main tools to sample from high dimensional probability
	distributions. Although asymptotic convergence of Markov chain Monte
	Carlo algorithms is ensured under weak assumptions, the performance
	of these algorithms is unreliable when the proposal distributions
	that are used to explore the space are poorly chosen and/or if highly
	correlated variables are updated independently. We show here how
	it is possible to build efficient high dimensional proposal distributions
	by using sequential Monte Carlo methods. This allows us not only
	to improve over standard Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes but also
	to make Bayesian inference feasible for a large class of statistical
	models where this was not previously so. We demonstrate these algorithms
	on a non-linear state space model and a Levy-driven stochastic volatility
	model.},

  abstract = {The purpose of time series analysis via mechanistic models is to reconcile
	the known or hypothesized structure of a dynamical system with observations
	collected over time. We develop a framework for constructing nonlinear
	mechanistic models and carrying out inference. Our framework permits
	the consideration of implicit dynamic models, meaning statistical
	models for stochastic dynamical systems which are specified by a
	simulation algorithm to generate sample paths. Inference procedures
	that operate on implicit models are said to have the plug-and-play
	property. Our work builds on recently developed plug-and-play inference
	methodology for partially observed Markov models. We introduce a
	class of implicitly specified Markov chains with stochastic transition
	rates, and we demonstrate its applicability to open problems in statistical
	inference for biological systems. As one example, these models are
	shown to give a fresh perspective on measles transmission dynamics.
	As a second example, we present a mechanistic analysis of cholera
	incidence data, involving interaction between two competing strains
	of the pathogen Vibrio cholerae.},

  abstract = {We present and evaluate an approach to analyzing population dynamics
	data using semimechanistic models. These models incorporate reliable
	information on population structure and underlying dynamic mechanisms
	but use nonparametric surface-fitting methods to avoid unsupported
	assumptions about the precise form of rate equations. Using historical
	data on measles epidemics as a case study, we show how this approach
	can lead to better forecasts, better characterizations of the dynamics,
	and a better understanding of the factors causing complex population
	dynamics relative to either mechanistic models or purely descriptive
	statistical time-series models. The semimechanistic models are found
	to have better forecasting accuracy than either of the model types
	used in previous analyses when tested on data not used to fit the
	models. The dynamics are characterized as being both nonlinear and
	noisy, and the global dynamics are clustered very tightly near the
	border of stability (dominant Lyapunov exponent lambda approximate
	to 0). However, locally in state space the dynamics oscillate between
	strong short-term stability and strong short-term chaos (i.e., between
	negative and positive local Lyapunov exponents). There is statistically
	significant evidence for short-term chaos in all data sets examined.
	Thus the nonlinearity in these systems is characterized by the variance
	over state space in local measures of chaos versus stability rather
	than a single summary measure of the overall dynamics as either chaotic
	or nonchaotic.},

  abstract = {Statistical inference for mechanistic models of partially observed
	dynamic systems is an active area of research. Most existing inference
	methods place substantial restrictions upon the form of models that
	can be fitted and hence upon the nature of the scientific hypotheses
	that can be entertained and the data that can be used to evaluate
	them. In contrast, the so-called methods require only simulations
	from a model and are thus free of such restrictions. We show the
	utility of the plug-and-play approach in the context of an investigation
	of measles transmission dynamics. Our novel methodology enables us
	to ask and answer questions that previous analyses have been unable
	to address. Specifically, we demonstrate that plug-and-play methods
	permit the development of a modelling and inference framework applicable
	to data from both large and small populations. We thereby obtain
	novel insights into the nature of heterogeneity in mixing and comment
	on the importance of including extra-demographic stochasticity as
	a means of dealing with environmental stochasticity and model misspecification.
	Our approach is readily applicable to many other epidemiological
	and ecological systems.},

	method is based on a sequence of filtering operations which are shown
	to converge to a maximum likelihood parameter estimate. We make use
	of recent advances in nonlinear filtering in the implementation of
	the algorithm. We apply the method to the study of cholera in Bangladesh.
	We construct confidence intervals, perform residual analysis, and

	modeling approaches},
  journal = {Ecology},
  year = {1999},
  volume = {80},
  pages = {1789--1805},
  abstract = {Population cycles have long fascinated ecologists. Even in the most-studied
	populations, however, scientists continue to dispute the relative
	importance of various potential causes of the cycles, Over the past
	three decades, theoretical ecologists have cataloged a large number
	of mechanisms that are capable of generating cycles in population
	models. At the same time, statisticians have developed new techniques
	both for characterizing time series and for fitting population models
	to time-series data. Both disciplines are now sufficiently advanced
	that great gains in understanding can be made by synthesizing these
	complementary, and heretofore mostly independent, quantitative approaches.
	In this paper we demonstrate how to apply this synthesis to the problem
	of population cycles, using both long-term population time series
	and the often-rich observational and experimental data on the ecology
	of the species in question. We quantify hypotheses by writing mathematical
	models that embody the interactions and forces that might cause cycles.
	Some hypotheses can be rejected out of hand, as being unable to generate
	even qualitatively appropriate dynamics, We finish quantifying the
	remaining hypotheses by estimating parameters, both from independent
	experiments and from fitting the models to the time-series data using
	modern statistical techniques, Finally, we compare simulated time
	series generated by the models to the observed time series, using
	a variety of statistical descriptors, which we refer to collectively
	as "probes." The model most similar to the data, as measured by these
	probes, is considered to be the most likely candidate to represent
	the mechanism underlying the population cycles. We illustrate this
	approach by analyzing one of Nicholson's blowfly populations, in
	which we know the "true" governing mechanism. Our analysis, which
	uses only a subset of the information available about the population,
	uncovers the correct answer, suggesting that this synthetic approach
	might be successfully applied to field populations as well.},

  volume = {75},
  pages = {259--276},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {The forest insect pest Bupalus piniarius (pine looper moth) is a classic
	example of a natural population cycle. As is typical for Populations
	that exhibit regular oscillations in density, there are several biological
	mechanisms that are hypothesized to be responsible for the cycles;
	but despite several decades of detailed study there has been no definite
	conclusion as to which mechanism is most important. We evaluated
	three hypotheses for which there was direct experimental evidence:
	(1) food quality (nutritional value of pine needles affected by defoliation);
	(2) parasitoids (trophic interactions with specialist parasitoids),
	and (3) maternal effects (maternal body size affects the performance
	of offspring). We reviewed the empirical evidence for each of these
	hypotheses and expressed each hypothesis in the form of a mechanistic
	dynamic model. We used a nonlinear forecasting approach to fit each
	model to three long-term Population time series in Britain that exhibit
	some degree of regular cycling, and we used parametric bootstrap
	to evaluate the significance of differences between models in their
	goodness of fit to the data. The results differed among the three
	forests: at Culbin, the parasitoid and maternal effects models fit
	equally well; at Roseisle, the food quality and maternal effects
	models fit equally well; and at Tentsmuir, the parasitoid model fit
	best. However, the best-fit parasitism models required that the parasitism
	rate vary between nearly 0 and nearly 1 during a cycle, greatly exceeding
	the range of parasitism rates that have been observed in the field.
	In contrast, the required variation in the observable maternal quality
	variable (pupal mass) was within the range of empirical observations.
	Under mild constraints on the parasitism rate (though allowing a
	much wider range than has been measured in B. piniarius at any location),
	the fit of the parasitism model fell off dramatically. The maternal
	effects model then had uniformly strong support, outperforming the
	constrained parasitism model at all three sites and the food quality
	model at two; it performed slightly better than the food quality
	model at the remaining site. This represents the first system in
	which the maternal effects hypothesis for population cycles has been
	supported by both strong biological and dynamical evidence.},

  abstract = {In many infectious diseases, an unknown fraction of infections produce
	symptoms mild enough to go unrecorded, a fact that can seriously
	compromise the interpretation of epidemiological records. This is
	true for cholera, a pandemic bacterial disease, where estimates of
	the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from
	3 to 100. In the absence of direct evidence, understanding of fundamental
	aspects of cholera transmission, immunology and control has been
	based on assumptions about this ratio and about the immunological
	consequences of inapparent infections. Here we show that a model
	incorporating high asymptomatic ratio and rapidly waning immunity,
	with infection both from human and environmental sources, explains
	50 yr of mortality data from 26 districts of Bengal, the pathogen's
	endemic home. We find that the asymptomatic ratio in cholera is far
	higher than had been previously supposed and that the immunity derived
	from mild infections wanes much more rapidly than earlier analyses
	have indicated. We find, too, that the environmental reservoir (free-living
	pathogen) is directly responsible for relatively few infections but
	that it may be critical to the disease's endemicity. Our results
	demonstrate that inapparent infections can hold the key to interpreting
	the patterns of disease outbreaks. New statistical methods, which
	allow rigorous maximum likelihood inference based on dynamical models
	incorporating multiple sources and outcomes of infection, seasonality,
	process noise, hidden variables and measurement error, make it possible
	to test more precise hypotheses and obtain unexpected results. Our
	experience suggests that the confrontation of time-series data with
	mechanistic models is likely to revise our understanding of the ecology
	of many infectious diseases.},

	known, however, about the typical duration of immunity and its epidemiological
	implications. Here, we analyze a simple mathematical model, exploring

	predictions are then contrasted with detailed incidence data for
	England and Wales. We find model output to be most sensitive to assumptions
