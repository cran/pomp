\title{News for package `pomp'}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.7}{
  \itemize{
    \item Improvement of the test suite and of error messages.
    \item Improve the \code{show} and \code{print} methods for \code{pomp} objects.
    \item Some internal refactoring.
    \item Improve error messages for missing basic components.
    \item Fix typos in one of the help-page examples.
    \item Several obscure bug-fixes.
    \item Add some references.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.6}{
  \itemize{
    \item Major revisions to the package help pages and manual.
    The separate documentation on C snippets and process-model plugins has been merged into the main \code{pomp} help page, which now has comprehensive instructions on building a \code{pomp} object.
    \item Update to the package help page.
    \item New methods for the Ensemble Kalman Filter (\code{enkf}) and Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (\code{eakf}) have been added to the package.
    \item There is a new plugin for \code{rprocess} called \code{kleap.sim}.
    This implements the so-called \dQuote{K-leap method} of Cai & Xu (2007).
    \item Major overhaul of error handling system and to error and warning messages.
    Many more errors are now trapped and reported with more informative messages.
    \item The matrix and numeric vector options for the \code{data} argument to \code{pomp} are now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
    In calls to \code{pomp}, \code{data} should be either a data frame or a \code{pomp}-class object.
    \item In \code{mif2}, it is now required that \code{Nmif>0}.
    \item Redundant \code{bootstrap} argument to \code{nlf} has been removed.
    \item Many improvements to the test suite to obtain better code coverage.
    \item Fixed bugs that might arise in rare circumstances in \code{simulate} and \code{eulermultinom} functions.
    \item Fixed a bug in \code{pompExample}.
    \item Fixed several small, rare bugs found as a result of improved testing.
    \item Fixed bug in specification of skeleton in pompExamples.
    \item \code{pomp} is no longer an S4 method.
    Its new status as an ordinary function abbreviates and consolidates the code and simplifies the documentation.
    \item A bug restricting access in C code to \code{userdata} has been fixed.
    \item Fixed bug in \code{pompExample(...,show=TRUE)}.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.5}{
  \itemize{
    \item A better interface for specifying a model's deterministic skeleton is provided.
    One specifies \code{skeleton=map(f,delta.t)} for a discrete-time skeleton (a map) and \code{skeleton=vectorfield(f)} for a continuous-time skeleton (a vectorfield).
    The old arguments \code{skeleton.type} and \code{skelmap.delta.t} are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
    \item The \code{pfilter} help page has been improved.
    Specifically, the discussion of filtering failures is better.
    \item Miscellaneous improvements to the help pages.
    \item \code{mif2} no longer computes filter means.
    \item The new argument \code{show} of \code{pompExamples} allows one to display the example code instead of executing it.
    \item The minimum version of \R supported is now 3.1.2.
    \item \code{init.state} now has the optional argument \code{nsim}.
    Using this, one can request multiple initial state vectors per parameter vector.
    \item \code{pfilter} now uses less memory when it is asked to run at a single point in parameter space.
    \item A bug associated with the \code{rw.sd} argument to \code{mif2} on Windows platforms has been fixed.
    \item The \code{method="mif2"} option to \code{mif} has been removed.
    Use \code{mif2} instead.
    \item The \code{particles} method (rarely if ever used), has been removed to streamline the \code{mif} codes.
    \item The \code{method="mif2"} option to \code{mif} is now deprecated.
    It will be removed in a future release.
    Use \code{mif2} instead.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.4}{
  \itemize{
    \item Following the publication of the Journal of Statistical Software announcement paper, the \file{CITATION} has been modified to include the appropriate citation.
    Please use \code{citation("pomp")} to learn about how to cite \pkg{pomp} correctly.
    \item \code{conv.rec} on the results of a \code{mif2} computation now play nicely with \code{reshape2::melt}.
    \item It is now possible to direct \code{pomp} to place \code{Csnippet} codes in a specified location.
    This is accomplished via the new \code{cdir} and \code{cfile} arguments to \code{pomp}.
    \item When several concurrent \R processes attempt to simultaneously compile \code{Csnipet} code from copies of a \code{pomp} object on the same machine, a race condition exists.
    This release fixes this by ensuring that \code{Csnippet} codes are written and compiled in a process-specific directory.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.3}{
  This release removes several long-deprecated features.
  \itemize{
    \item The \code{seed} argument to \code{pfilter} has been removed.
    Use \code{freeze} to obtain similar functionality.
    \item The redundant \code{pars} argument to \code{mif} has been removed.
    Names of parameters to be estimated are taken from the nonzero entries of \code{rw.sd}.
    Initial-value parameters are designated using the \code{ivps} argument.
    \item The old \code{parameter.transform} and \code{parameter.inv.transform} arguments to \code{pomp} have been removed.
    They were superseded by the arguments \code{fromEstimationScale} and \code{toEstimationScale} in version 0.65-1.
    \item Some internal changes to \code{mif2} by C. Breto, in support of panel methods under development.
  }
}
\section{Changes in \pkg{pomp} version 1.2}{
  \itemize{
    \item Bug fix: for POMPs with a scalar state variable, the \code{filter.mean}, \code{pred.mean}, and \code{pred.var} methods dropped the singleton dimension of the respective arrays, in conflict with the assumptions of certain \code{plot} methods.
    This resolves issue #3.
    \item Documentation improvements.
    Specifically, the details of how step-sizes are chosen in the \code{euler.sim}, \code{discrete.time.sim}, and \code{onestep.sim} plugins has been spelled out explicitly.
    Also, incompleteness in the \code{sannbox} documentation has been corrected.
    \item Provide \code{filter.traj} method for \code{pmcmcList} objects.
    \item Fixed a bug in \code{mif} and \code{mif2} when \code{cooling.type="hyperbolic"} and \code{cooling.fraction.50=1}.
